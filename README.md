### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Louis, a budding Software Engineer from the midwest excited about all the opportunities to learn new things in tech.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... **[Boltleg](https://github.com/LouisSavoie/boltleg)**, a [Puppet Bolt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt) clone. This is a learning exercise for me in many Ruby-based technologies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Ruby stuff! The language itself as well as Gems, Rake, Rubocop, Rspec, and how to use these tools with GitHub Actions.
